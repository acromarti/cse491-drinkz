Similar to the load bottle type and load inventory function, I created a load recipes in drinkz.load_bulk_data.py that only takes vaild recipe lines where the first value of the line is the name and the rest of the line is the recipe's ingredients.  Also I wrote a file in the bin directory called load-liquor-recipes which utilizes the function load_recipes.

To run the test:

  1. python load-liquor-recipes filename
  2. Note: filename is an argument

In the file that is loaded it must be formated where the recipe name and its ingredients are seperated by commas

For Example

  name1, ingredient 1, amount 1, ingredient 2, amount 2
  name2, ingredient 1, amount 1, ingredient 2, amount 2
  
I used a test_bulk_load_recipes in test-drinkz to also test these functions
